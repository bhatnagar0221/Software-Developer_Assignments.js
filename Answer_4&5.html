<!-- Short Note on Tag -->

1) An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning and
end of an HTML element in an HTML document. As part of an HTML element, HTML
tags help web browsers convert HTML documents into web pages. <br />
2) HTML tag starts with < and ends with >. <br />
3) HTML tags are almost like keywords where every single tag has unique meaning.
<br />
Example - <tag> </tag> }-- is a complete set of opening and closing tag.

<!-- element -->
1) Elements enclose the contents in between the tags. They consist of some kind
of structure or expression. It generally consists of a start tag, content and an
end tag. <br />
Example - <b>This is the content.</b> }-- the combinations of tag is a HTML
Element. <br />

<!-- Doctype Declaration -->

1) The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser
about what document type to expect. <br />
2) The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what
version of HTML the page is written in. <br />
3) This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web
browsers. <br />
